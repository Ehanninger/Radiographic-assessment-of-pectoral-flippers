# Radiographic assessment of pectoral flippers

This repository currently contains R code supporting analyses of radiographic pectoral flipper ossification in common dolphins (*Delphinus delphis*). The code was developed to support probabilistic inference of sexual maturity and comparative evaluation of radiographic ossification frameworks.

## Scope and associated publications

The R scripts in this repository accompany and support multiple related manuscripts that address complementary aspects of radiographic skeletal assessment:

1. **Cross-species applicability of a bone-ageing method in delphinids** (in press)
     
   - Inter-observer error: potential observer-related bias was assessed using generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs; lme4 package) on a subset of 40 radiographs independently scored by two observers.
   
   - Correlation with age: relationships between ossification scores and dental age were evaluated using Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ), analysed separately for males and females.
   
   - Precedence matrix analysis: pairwise comparisons among bones were used to determine the typical developmental order of ossification and to visualise sex- and side-specific variation.
   
3. **Radiographic assessment of bone maturation: A tool to estimate sexual maturity in common dolphins (*Delphinus delphis*)?**
     
   - Uses the code to model the relationship between flipper ossification patterns and sexual maturity using probabilistic approaches.
