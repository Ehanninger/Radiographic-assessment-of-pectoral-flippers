# Radiographic assessment of pectoral flippers

This repository currently contains R code supporting analyses of radiographic pectoral flipper ossification in common dolphins (*Delphinus delphis*). The code was developed to support probabilistic inference of sexual maturity and comparative evaluation of radiographic ossification frameworks.

## Scope and associated publications

The R scripts in this repository accompany and support multiple related manuscripts that address complementary aspects of radiographic skeletal assessment:

1. **Cross-species applicability of radiographic flipper ossification** (in press)  
   – Uses the code to evaluate the transferability of radiographic ossification frameworks across cetacean species.

2. **Radiographic assessment of bone maturation: A tool to estimate sexual maturity in common dolphins**  
   – Uses the code to model the relationship between flipper ossification patterns and sexual maturity using probabilistic approaches.

While the same analytical framework is used across these studies, each manuscript addresses a distinct research question and analytical objective. Data used in the analyses are archived separately and referenced in the respective publications.

## Repository contents

The repository currently includes:
- R scripts for data processing, statistical modelling, and figure generation
