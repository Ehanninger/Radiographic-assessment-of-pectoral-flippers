# Radiographic assessment of pectoral flippers

This repository currently contains R code supporting analyses of radiographic pectoral flipper ossification in common dolphins (*Delphinus delphis*). The code was developed to support probabilistic inference of sexual maturity and comparative evaluation of radiographic ossification frameworks.

## Scope and associated publications

The R scripts in this repository accompany and support multiple related manuscripts that address complementary aspects of radiographic skeletal assessment:

1. **Cross-species applicability of radiographic flipper ossification** (in press)  
   – Inter-observer error: potential observer-related bias was tested using generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs; lme4 package) on a subset of 40 radiographs scored by two independent observers.
   – Correlation of ossification scores with age: relationships between ossification stage and dental age were assessed using Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ), run separately for males and females.
   – Precedence matrix analysis: pairwise comparisons among bones were used to establish the typical developmental order of ossification and to visualize sex- and side-specific variation.
   
3. **Radiographic assessment of bone maturation: A tool to estimate sexual maturity in common dolphins**  
   – Uses the code to model the relationship between flipper ossification patterns and sexual maturity using probabilistic approaches.

While the same analytical framework is used across these studies, each manuscript addresses a distinct research question and analytical objective. Data used in the analyses are archived separately and referenced in the respective publications.
